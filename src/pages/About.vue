    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>
      <i>A software developer with a passion for all things tech related and a problem with spending money on gig tickets and football kits.</i>

      <b>I build things for the internet.</b> Whether it's an e-commerce platform, <a href="/post/a-new-beginning">this website</a> you're staring at or super complex language processing tools.  
      A back-end developer by job title focusing on the .NET framework and Azure, however I love trying out new technologies and occasionaly get lost in the world of front-end.
      I consider myself an expert in abandoning projects, and something I hope to stop doing so often.. Currently this site has been my latest pet, and if you're reading this, success!

      I graduated from Bournemouth Uni in 2017 with a degree in Software Engineering, 
      not spending enough time by the beach however motivated me to stick around and was fortunate enough to work for one of the <a href="https://redweb.com">top agencies</a>
      in the south west and introduced me to CMS development.
      After moving back to London I started working for this <a href="https://thetin.net">super cool agency</a> where we develop on a range of different technologies and platforms.
